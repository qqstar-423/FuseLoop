# Contributing to FlagOS Skills

Thanks for your interest in contributing to FlagOS Skills! This guide will help you get started.

## Getting Started

### Creating a New Skill

```bash
# 1. Create directory
mkdir skills/<skill-name>

# 2. Copy template
cp template/SKILL.md skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md

# 3. Edit SKILL.md
#    - Update frontmatter (name, description, etc.)
#    - Write agent instructions
#    - Add examples and troubleshooting guide

# 4. (Optional) Add supporting files
mkdir skills/<skill-name>/references  # Reference docs
mkdir skills/<skill-name>/scripts     # Scripts
mkdir skills/<skill-name>/assets      # Resources

# 5. Validate
python scripts/validate_skills.py
```

### Updating an Existing Skill

1. Find the corresponding `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. Make your changes
3. If adding new scripts/resources, document their usage in SKILL.md
4. Run validation

## Skill Quality Checklist

Before submitting a PR, please verify:

- [ ] `SKILL.md` contains complete YAML frontmatter (at least `name` + `description`)
- [ ] `name` field matches the directory name, all lowercase with hyphens
- [ ] `description` is a complete sentence explaining "what it does" + "when to trigger"
- [ ] Body includes: Overview, Prerequisites, Execution steps, Examples (2-3), Troubleshooting
- [ ] All referenced scripts/resource files actually exist
- [ ] Scripts have execute permissions (`chmod +x`)
- [ ] No hardcoded internal paths, secrets, or credentials

## Naming Conventions

| Scope | Rule | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| Directory name | Lowercase + hyphens | `model-migrate-flagos` |
| `name` field | Must match directory name | `model-migrate-flagos` |
| Script filenames | Lowercase + underscores | `validate_migration.py` |
| Reference docs | Lowercase + hyphens | `compatibility-patches.md` |

Avoid:
- Vague names: `misc`, `utils`, `tmp`, `v1`, `test`
- Overly long names: keep to 3-4 words
